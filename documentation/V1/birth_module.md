# Birth module 
* Input: birth year and birth projection.
* We simply set the sex and birth year of an agent. To determine the sex, we toss a coin where the probability is given by the birth projection estimated by Statistics Canada (see the proportion of male across the years [here](../../processed_data/birth_projection_Sept2020.csv))
